== RO and BFO2 ==

RO makes use of BFO in two ways:

 * Upper level classes from BFO are used to make constraints such as domain/range on relations
 * RO cedes "core" relations such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 part_of] to BFO

This plan was conceived in 2010 before the release of BFO2. At the time of writing (March 2013), the current BFO2 proposal is to use so-called 'temporalized relations' such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000177 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000137]. These are incompatible with the non-temporalized relations in RO.

At this time, RO will not be adopting temporalized relations. The views of one of the RO developers (cjm) is expressed in [https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf this critique of BFO2].

For historic reasons, RO makes use of a small number of relations in the BFO ID space

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 BFO_0000050 part_of] 
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 BFO_0000051 has_part]
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000052 BFO_0000052 inheres_in]
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000053 bearer_of]
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000054 realized in] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000055 realizes] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000056 BFO_0000056 participates_in] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000057 BFO_0000057 has_participant] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000060 BFO_0000060 preceded by] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000060 BFO_0000063 precedes] `*`
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000066 BFO_0000066 occurs_in] `*`

These will continue to be supported. It should be understood that with the exception of those marked `*`, these are not part of an official release of BFO. It is the hope of the RO developers that they will eventually be included in a BFO2 release. In the interim, these relations are considered to be owned by RO (despite the fact the IDs are in the BFO ID range). The RO developers are committed to maintaining these relations for as long as the OBO community needs them.

The current home of these relations is in:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/bfo_1_2_relations_import.owl

This is imported by RO, and should be considered to be a part of RO. The exception is [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000066 BFO_0000066 occurs_in] which should be considered owned by BFO2 and cloned in RO. 

Note that RO should still be compatible with the classes from BFO.

The above relations import ontology imports a set of BFO classes that are a subset of the current BFO2 classes.
