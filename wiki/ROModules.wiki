#summary RO Modules

= Introduction =

The current version of RO includes both general and specific relations from multiple domains.

= Extracting Modules =

== Automatic Module Extraction ==

There are a number of ways to automatically extract a module from an ontology - the OWLAPI implements some of these.

In principle it should be possible to extract a module from the RO using these tools. Details will be posted here later

== Manual Module Extraction ==

Another method is to manually take the properties and/or related axioms one requires and copy them into the working ontology. This technique is not ideal, but the operation is relatively infrequent since most ontologies do not use large numbers of relations. This is the method that has been used in practice for GO, the drosophila anatomy, Uberon, etc.
