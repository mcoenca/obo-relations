# Introduction #

This page describes the following ontology:

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/core.owl

Which is a set of core relations that are relatively domain-neutral

# Details #

This ontology is a subset of the full RO. It excludes most domain-specific relations (such as the "habitat of" relation used in environmental ontologies, or the "synapsed with" relation used in neuroanatomical ontologies), and includes "core" relations intended to be domain neutral.

This includes

  * part\_of
  * participates\_in
  * occurs\_in
  * ...

# Relationship to BFO #

Many of these relations correspond to relations in BFO2. Please see [ROAndBFO](ROAndBFO.md) for an explanation.
