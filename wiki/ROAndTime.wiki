#summary Treatment of time in RO

= Introduction =

Relationships such as 'part_of' can change over time. For example, a cell can be part of the neuroepithelium at one time, and then detached from it at a later time.

For a detailed treatment, see the [http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R46 original RO paper]. Unfortunately the relations in this paper are difficult to represent directly in OWL. Our current strategy is to use "atemporal" binary relations such as part_of with the understanding that the spirit of the RO paper should be followed - i.e. any class axioms such as "nucleus SubClassOf part_of some cell" should be understood to hold true for any "snapshot" in time.

We are currently working on a more formal treatment. One possible approach is to use 'temporalized relations', but this suffers from problems, and the RO is unlikely to adopt these in the near future. See [https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf this critique of BFO2] for more details.
