For example, fins to an aquatic environment. Usually this will mean that the structure is adapted for this environment, but we avoid saying this directly - primitive forms of the structure may not have evolved specifically for that environment (for example, early wings were not necessarily adapted for an aerial environment). Note also that this is a statement about the general class of structures - not every instance of a limb need confer an advantage for a terrestrial environment, e.g. if the limb is vestigial." xsd:string
