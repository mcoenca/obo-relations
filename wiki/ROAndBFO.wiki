#summary Interoperation with BFO

This page describes the current status of interoperation between RO and BFO

== RO and BFO2 ==

RO historically use of BFO in two ways:

 * Upper level *classes* from BFO are used to make constraints such as domain/range on relations
 * RO ceded "core" *relations* such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 part_of] to BFO

This plan was conceived in 2010 before the release of BFO2. At the time of writing (March 2013), the current BFO2 proposal is to use so-called 'temporalized relations' such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000177 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000137].

RO will *not* be adopting temporalized relations. The views of one of the RO developers (cjm) is expressed in [https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf this critique of BFO2 OWL].

For historic reasons, RO has made use of a number of relations with BFO IDs. For example:

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 BFO_0000050 part_of] 
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 BFO_0000051 has_part]

Note that these will *not* be incorporated into the BFO2 OWL release. However, they are official stable identifiers and are under the menagement of the RO project. The RO developers are committed to maintaining these identifiers for as long as users need them.

RO also makes use of others relations that are either uncontroversial (non-temporalized) parts of BFO2, or that will be incorporated in the future.

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000060 BFO_0000060 preceded by] (not in BFO2, but may be in the future. We assume this is the transitive form)
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000060 BFO_0000063 precedes] `*` (not in BFO2, but may be in the future. We assume this is the transitive form)
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000066 BFO_0000066 occurs_in] (in BFO2)

In previous versions of RO we made use of other unofficial non-temporalized relations. To avoid potential clashes with temporalized relations with different meanings, we have decided to create separate IDs with RO prefixes:

  * inheres in [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000052 BFO_0000052] ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000052 RO_0000052] 
 * bearer of [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000053] ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000053 RO_0000053]
 * realized in [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000054] ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000053 RO_0000054] 
 * realizes [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000053 BFO_0000055]  ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000053 RO_0000055] 
 * participates in [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000056 BFO_0000056]  ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000056 RO_0000056] 
 * has participant [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000057 BFO_0000057]  ==>  [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0000057 RO_0000057] 


The current home of these relations is in:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/core.owl

See [ROCore] for more details.

== RO and BFO Classes ==

Note that RO should still be compatible with the classes from BFO.

The above relations import ontology imports a set of BFO classes that are a subset of the current BFO2 classes.
