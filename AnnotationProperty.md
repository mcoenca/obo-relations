In OWL Annotation Properties are 'non-logical' properties that connect individuals, classes, ObjectProperty, other annotation properties etc with other object or with literal values. Technically, it connects the IRI of these entities.

The 'non-logical' aspect means they are ignored for reasoning purposes.

They are primarily used for metadata: labels, definitions, synonyms, attribution, notes and comments, etc.
