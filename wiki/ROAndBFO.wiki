#summary Interoperation with BFO

= Introduction =

This page describes the current status of interoperation between RO and BFO

= Details =

RO makes use of BFO in two ways:

 * Upper level classes from BFO are used to make constraints such as domain/range on relations
 * RO cedes "core" relations such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 part_of] to BFO

At the time of writing (March 2013), the current BFO2 proposal is to use so-called 'temporalized relations' such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000177 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000137].

At this time, RO will not be adopting temporalized relations. The views of one of the RO developers (cjm) is expressed in [https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf this critique of BFO2].
