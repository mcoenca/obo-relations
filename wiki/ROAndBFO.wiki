#summary Interoperation with BFO

This page describes the current status of interoperation between RO and BFO

== RO and BFO2 ==

RO makes use of BFO in two ways:

 * Upper level classes from BFO are used to make constraints such as domain/range on relations
 * RO cedes "core" relations such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 part_of] to BFO

This plan was conceived in 2010 before the release of BFO2. At the time of writing (March 2013), the current BFO2 proposal is to use so-called 'temporalized relations' such as [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000177 http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000137].

At this time, RO will not be adopting temporalized relations. The views of one of the RO developers (cjm) is expressed in [https://github.com/cmungall/trel-crit/raw/master/trc.pdf this critique of BFO2].

For historic reasons, RO makes use of a small number of relations in the BFO ID space

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 part_of]
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051 has_part]

It should be understood that these are not part of an official release of BFO. It is the hope of the RO developers that they will eventually be included in a BFO2 release. In the interim, these relations are considered to be owned by RO. The RO developers are committed to maintaining these relations for as long as the OBO community needs them.
